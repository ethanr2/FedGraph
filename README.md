# FedGraph
Code that takes data on all historical US recessions and plots them on frequency and duration

recData.xlsx is an excel sheet with the data copy and pasted from the tables on this wikipedia page: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_recessions_in_the_United_States

The idea I wanted to show is that recessions in the United States were more frequent and lasted longer before the creation of the Federal Reserve.

recGraph is the final output, it should look like this: https://i.imgur.com/498CArS.png

The actual code is in the jupyter notebook file. Uses Bokeh, Pandas, and Numpy.
